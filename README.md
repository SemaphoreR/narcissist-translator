# Narcissist Translator

A browser-based translator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The purpose of this project is to give whoever is using it a well-needed laugh and to point out that, no matter what pretty words and sentiments a narcissist uses to try to get back in contact, it all boils down to the same self-centered arguments.

I built this translator for a friend who was struggling to go no-contact with narcissistic family members and was demoralized by their constant letters and emails. I translated a number of these messages manually before I realized that
1. These notes all say the same handful of things over and over and
2. I could automate said translation.

The unhinged rambling nature of the translation is a feature, not a bug.
